# Directus Cloud

> Directus Cloud is our paid content-as-a-service (CaaS) platform. It offers quick setup, auto-updates, a global CDN, and premium support.

## Private Beta

Currenty Directus Cloud is in an invite-only private beta. Below are some use resources for getting started.

## Platform Overview

Directus Cloud has three main levels:

* *Accounts* — Individual Cloud access tied to an email address. (Free)
* *Teams* — A group of accounts with one owner used for consolidated billing. (Free)
* *Projects* — An instance of Directus attached to a Team. (Paid. Cost based on chosen plan.)

## Dashboard

When you log-in to Directus Cloud you will be taken to the Dashbaord. This page will give you a bird's eye view over all your teams and projects.

### Directus Version

You'll never need to worry about keeping Directus up-to-date on Directus Cloud, we automatically update the entire service each week. We intentionally keep the Cloud API 1-2 releases behind the OSS version (except for security patches) to avoid pushing any issues to our paying customers. This way, we're able to collect feedback from hundreds-of-thousands of open-source community members and identify/resolve bugs before they reach Cloud. You can see the current version in the header of the Dashboard.

### System Status

The current Directus Cloud system status is always visible at the top of the dashboard's header. Additionally, all customers will recieve emails reports for outages and resolution.

## Accounts

Directus Cloud accounts are how individuals access the platform. Accounts are free and tied to your email address.
